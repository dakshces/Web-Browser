# Web-Browser

This is the a bare-bones rendering engine using the steps outlined by Matt Brubeck (https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html). 
To run the code open Main.java.
You will have to change the source directories of css.txt and html.txt (included in the package). Output will be saved to "WebPage.jpg"
The biggest feature missing is that text is not rendered. Will have to figure out how to do this.
